I am a computer science post graduate and currently working as a Data Scientist in Japan.

Iâ€™m passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning to areas in NLP where we can really engineer better solutions for helping people to understand the insights of languages. In my mind, machine learning and computer science really have the power to make the computers understand and produce different languages. If you are working in the NLP or any other Data Science field, don't hesitate to reach out if you think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Would love to discuss.
**Email me if you're looking to collaborate on future projects. Always open to new opportunities**
